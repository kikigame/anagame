OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --wwoorrddss
                   This specifies a dictionary file. Suitable dictionaries are
                   available for common spellcheckers such as ispell.  Each line in
                   the file should contain a correctly-spelled word.  Any words that
                   consist entirely of lower-case letters (in the current locale)
                   will be considered as anagram solutions. B<-w> and B<-file> are
                   understood as synonyms.

       --ssttaarrtt
                   The number of letters in the shortest anagram. This option is an
                   integer, although values that are not counting numbers will not
                   yield anagrams.  B<-s>, B<-begin> and B<-min> are understood as
                   synonyms.

       --eenndd
                   This is the longest length of anagram to attempt to find.
                   Completing an anagram of this length may be considered a win. If
                   start is greater than end, you will not get any anagrams. This
                   option is an integer.  B<-e> and B<-fin> are understood as
                   synonyms.

       --hhiinnttss
                   If set, alphagram hints will be shown on the prompt. Alphagrams
                   are the letters of the anagram sorted into alphabetical order; one
                   technique for solving anagrams is to memorise the alphagram of
                   each word. B<-hint> and B<-h> are understood as synonyms.

       --vveerrssiioonn
                   Basic version information. B<-v> is understood as a synonym.
                   Use of this option will prevent the game from running.

       --hheellpp
                   A help message. B<-he> and B<-?> are understood as synonyms.
                   Use of this option will prevent the game from running.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The user is presented with a number of randomised anagrams of
       increasing length. Upon solving and typing in the correct word, a
       longer anagram puzzle is presented. Where more than one anagram exists,
       one specific anagram is required; this assists the user with learning
       anagrams.

       The user can give up at any time by sending an end-of-file (usually
       _c_t_r_l_+_D) or interrupt signal (usually _c_t_r_l_+_C); the solution to the
       current anagram will be displayed.

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       If the dictionary file contains rude words, or other words of dubious
       origin, then these may be produced by the program. It has no taste
       filter.

       The words produced by this game come from the dictionary file of your
       computer, and the author of this package is not responsible for them.

DDEEPPEENNDDEENNCCIIEESS
       LLiisstt::::UUttiill
               Standard with Perl 5.8.0+. Used to create the anagrams.

       TTeerrmm::::RReeaaddLLiinnee
               Standard with Perl 5.8.0+, but a stub library. This is used for
               console interaction. See the section "READLINE NOTE" below for
               compatibility with other Readline packages.

       PPeerrll::::UUnnssaaffee::::SSiiggnnaallss
               This package can be installed through CCPPAANN, perhaps like this:
               "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Perl::Unsafe::Signals'".  This works
               around an annoying bug with TTeerrmm::::RReeaaddLLiinnee::::GGNNUU if used; see
               the section on "READLINE NOTE" for further details. In a
               nutshell, it allows the game to exit when you press _C_t_r_l_+_C,
               without requiring you to then press _E_n_t_e_r.

       PPoodd::::UUssaaggee
               Standard with Perl 5.8.0+. Used along with GGeettoopptt::::LLoonngg for, to
               implement the hheellpp and uussaaggee command-line options.

       GGeettoopptt::::LLoonngg
               This package can be installed through CCPPAANN, perhaps like this:
               "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Getopt::Long'".  If available, this
               allows you to control the game through the command-line
               options, perhaps to specify a different dictionary file or to
               turn on alphagram hints.

RREEAADDLLIINNEE NNOOTTEE
       Having installed TTeerrmm::::RReeaaddLLiinnee, Anagame has basic support to ask the
       user for their guesses. However, some obvious features won't work, such
       as using the cursor keys to navigate to previous answers.

       To fix this, you can install other packages, such as:

       Term::ReadLine::Perl
               This package can be installed through CCPPAANN, perhaps like this:
               "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Term::ReadLine::Perl'".  This package
               provides Perl functions to provide basic shell history.

       Term::ReadLine::Gnu
               This package can be installed through CCPPAANN, perhaps like this:
               "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Term::ReadLine::Gnu'". The standard
               installation requires the GNU rreeaaddlliinnee development files to be
               installed on your computer, along with a suitable C language
               compiler; Windows users may find this as an optional extra when
               they install Perl.  This package will be used in preference to
               TTeerrmm::::RReeaaddLLiinnee::::PPeerrll (or any other implementation) if
               available, as it provides additional features, to allow
               callback handling, password input and filename completion.
               These are of no use to Anagame, but we have no way to indicate
               this to TTeerrmm::::RReeaaddLLiinnee.

       If you are unfortunate enough to have _T_e_r_m_:_:_R_e_a_d_L_i_n_e_:_:_G_n_u installed,
       then it is suggested that you also install Perl::Unsafe::Signals. As
       the name suggests, there is a slight risk to this package, as it can
       allow the program to be interrupted at any time, including during
       memory allocation and deallocation; this may cause memory corruption
       that could conceivably be used to breach the operating system security.
       To minimise that risk, the unsafe signals are enabled only when
       actually asking the user for the response, not when calculating the
       anagram itself. There is no risk if the game is idle waiting for a
       keypress when an interrupt occurs.

       You can further minimise any risk by always running the game as a
       regular user, never as a superuser or administrator.
